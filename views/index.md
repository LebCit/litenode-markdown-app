# LiteNode Markdown-based Application

**Creating a Markdown-based Application in Node.js with LiteNode**

Welcome to the homepage of this tutorial! Here, we dive into every detail of creating a [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)-based application using [LiteNode](https://litenode.pages.dev/) in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your coding journey, you'll discover how LiteNode's simplicity makes it a breeze to build applications with Markdown. I really hope this tutorial helps everyone in some way! So, dive in, explore, and have fun learning!

## Requirements {#requirements}

All you need for this tutorial is to download and install Node.js on your machine. The easiest way to do this is by downloading the [Prebuilt Installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) that matches your machine's specifications. Always opt for the Long Term Support (LTS) version.

## Coverage

This tutorial will cover the following aspects:

-   **Backend:**

    1. Installing necessary dependencies
    2. Organizing folders and files
    3. Creating routes and functions
    4. Building and rendering templates
    5. Generating a static site

-   **Frontend:**
    -   Organizing the static assets directory
    -   Loading static files in templates
    -   Creating a minimal responsive design
    -   Using and styling custom HTML tags
    -   Providing tips and multipurpose development links

**Note:** We will not use any frontend framework!

## Project

We are going to build a small web application, exploring the following steps:

-   Markdown simplicity: Writing in plain text format
-   Frontmatter usage: The dynamic data block
-   Parsing Markdown: Converting Markdown to HTML
-   Rendering: Displaying converted HTML with data
-   Using templates to organize our app structure
-   Controlling template rendering with conditions
-   Advanced structures: Looping through arrays in templates

And much more, all with LiteNode's simplicity!

## Purpose

I've written numerous articles on templating and working with Markdown in Node.js. This tutorial aims to be the definitive guide, presented as a web application rather than a simple article. Additionally, this tutorial demonstrates:

-   How LiteNode reduces the need for additional dependencies and simplifies development.
-   LiteNode's capability to encompass everything necessary for building small to medium-sized web applications.
-   LiteNode's suitability for developing APIs and microservices.
-   How LiteNode efficiently builds, serves, and generates static websites without heavy tooling.
